NOTICE: Teams 319 and 1619 are now collaborating on this project in a new repo located here: https://github.com/Team1619/project-line-cross

# auto-for-everyone
An open-source effort to help all teams achieve a cross-the-line auto in 2018

## Each implementation should:

- Be placed in a directory that has the same name as the language that the implementation is written in
- Be as generic as possible so that it can be applied to any robot on the field with minimal setup
- Be as simple as possible so that any team has the capacity to understand it.
- Have as many comments it needs to have in order to be understood by any team
- Make a robot cross the line in autonomous mode with as little setup as possible
- Be properly commented
